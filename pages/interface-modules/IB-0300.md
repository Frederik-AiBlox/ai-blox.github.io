## Description

The IB-0300 is ideal for camera vision applications that require high throughput and Power-over-Ethernet (PoE). 

The module has an integrated PoE PSE Type 2 supply, which provides 30W at each connector. This eliminates the need for an external PoE injector or PoE switch.

Each Ethernet port is separated with its own MAC address, to ensure each camera to stream at maximum throughput of 100Mbps.

The block diagram above shows the 5 main parts:
* USB2.0 Hubs
* 4 MAC & PHY 
* PoE PSE


The 4 100Mbps Ethernet connections are spread over 2 USB2.0 Hubs. These hubs are connected to the USB3.0 interfaces of the BLOX. Each Ethernet connection has its own MAC or Media Access Controller. This results in 4 hardware separated connections for maximum throughput of 100Mbps. 

A PoE PSE or Power-over-Ethernet Power Sourcing Equipment Type 2 provides 30W at each connector.

### P1 to P4 port

The P1..P4 are RJ45 connectors of the 10/100Mbits Ethernet ports. 

Each connector hast 2 status LEDs available:

* Link status - Green LED
* Activity status - Orange LED


The P1..P4 ports RJ45 connector with standard pin out:
